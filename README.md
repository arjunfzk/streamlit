# streamlit
I used Flask and a library called wikipedia https://wikipedia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code.html, to create the api and deploy it on heroku.
The library takes an input and returns a summary for the words, but due to multiple pages available for same words, 
it returns an error if there is no unique perfect match. While I am looking to solve this, I request you to use multiple keywords.

I used the streamlit, spacy and streamlit-spacy library to call the api and the then run named-entity-recognition. The output in the app is exactly same as the image provided.
